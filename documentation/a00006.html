<div class="textblock"><p>Urho3D uses the following conventions and principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-handed coordinates. Positive X, Y &amp; Z axes point to the right, up, and forward, and positive rotation is clockwise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Degrees are used for angles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Clockwise vertices define a front face.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Audio volume is specified from 0.0 (silence) to 1.0 (full volume)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Path names use slash instead of backslash. Paths will be converted internally into the necessary format when calling into the operating system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the script API, properties are used whenever appropriate instead of Set... and Get... functions. If the setter and getter require index parameters, the property will use array-style indexing, and its name will be in plural. For example model-&gt;SetMaterial(0, myMaterial) in C++ would become model.materials[0] = myMaterial in script.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Raw pointers are used whenever possible in the classes' public API. This simplifies exposing functions &amp; classes to script, and is relatively safe, because <a class="el" href="a00270.html" title="Shared pointer template class with intrusive reference counting.">SharedPtr</a> &amp; <a class="el" href="a00326.html" title="Weak pointer template class with intrusive reference counting. Does not keep the object pointed to al...">WeakPtr</a> use intrusive reference counting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>No C++ exceptions. Error return values (false / null pointer / dummy reference) are used instead. Script exceptions are used when there is no other sensible way, such as with out of bounds array access.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Feeding illegal data to public API functions, such as out of bounds indices or null pointers, should not cause crashes or corruption. Instead errors are logged as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Third party libraries are included as source code for the build process. They are however hidden from the public API as completely as possible.</li>
</ul>
