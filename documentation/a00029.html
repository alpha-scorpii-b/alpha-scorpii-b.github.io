<div class="textblock"><p>The <a class="el" href="a00157.html" title="Input subsystem. Converts operating system window messages to input state and events.">Input</a> subsystem provides keyboard, mouse, joystick and touch input via both a polled interface and events. It is always instantiated, even in headless mode, but is active only once the application window has been created. Once active, the subsystem takes over the operating system mouse cursor. It will be hidden by default, so the <a class="el" href="a00322.html" title="UI subsystem. Manages the graphical user interface.">UI</a> should be used to render a software cursor if necessary. For editor-like applications the operating system cursor can be made visible by calling <a class="el" href="a00157.html#a5a8edc8ee7876348bfa4e95f9d901805">SetMouseVisible()</a>.</p>
<p>The input events include:</p>
<ul>
<li>E_MOUSEBUTTONUP: a mouse button was released.</li>
<li>E_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN: a mouse button was pressed.</li>
<li>E_MOUSEMOVE: the mouse moved.</li>
<li>E_MOUSEWHEEL: the mouse wheel moved.</li>
<li>E_KEYUP: a key was released.</li>
<li>E_KEYDOWN: a key was pressed.</li>
<li>E_CHAR: translation of a keypress to Unicode charset for text entry. This is currently the only way to get translated key input.</li>
<li>E_TOUCHBEGIN: a finger touched the screen.</li>
<li>E_TOUCHEND: a finger was lifted from the screen.</li>
<li>E_TOUCHMOVE: a finger moved on the screen.</li>
<li>E_JOYSTICKBUTTONDOWN: a joystick button was pressed.</li>
<li>E_JOYSTICKBUTTONUP: a joystick button was released.</li>
<li>E_JOYSTICKAXISMOVE: a joystick axis was moved.</li>
<li>E_JOYSTICKHATMOVE: a joystick POV hat was moved.</li>
<li>E_CONTROLLERBUTTONDOWN: a joystick button on an SDL controller was pressed.</li>
<li>E_CONTROLLERBUTTONUP: a joystick button on an SDL controller was released.</li>
<li>E_CONTROLLERAXISMOVE: a joystick axis on an SDL controller was moved.</li>
</ul>
<p>The input polling API differentiates between the initiation of a key/mouse button press, and holding the key or button down. <a class="el" href="a00157.html#a81672eb3d3a9fd640a552169f4e1883e">GetKeyPress()</a> and <a class="el" href="a00157.html#a663bad42c0fe6b58452c5ebba35c72ae">GetMouseButtonPress()</a> return true only for one frame (the initiation) while <a class="el" href="a00157.html#a8995ff227b84083c0b1a9050bb211357">GetKeyDown()</a> and <a class="el" href="a00157.html#aa086b042b00127bc840719c7ddcdf33f">GetMouseButtonDown()</a> return true as long as the key or button is held down.</p>
<p>In script, the polling API is accessed via properties: input.keyDown[], input.keyPress[], input.mouseButtonDown[], input.mouseButtonPress[], input.mouseMove.</p>
<p>To get joystick input, the joystick(s) must first be explicitly opened using <a class="el" href="a00157.html#abba6aa20e1958a0bf3b22a11810260a4">OpenJoystick()</a>. Accessing the polled joystick state using <a class="el" href="a00157.html#a61a4fd7c7fa9550c33792943b2825c2b">GetJoystick()</a> also automatically opens the joystick. The plugged in joysticks are detected on application start and must be manually redetected using <a class="el" href="a00157.html#aa7f01e33cc110c8d3fadc91050ec9554">DetectJoysticks()</a> if they are plugged in or disconnected during runtime.</p>
<p>If the joystick model is recognized by SDL you will also get the "controller" variety of events shown above, and the buttons and axes mappings utilize known constants such as CONTROLLER_BUTTON_A or CONTROLLER_AXIS_LEFTX without having to guess them.</p>
<p>From the input subsystem you can also query whether the application window has input focus, or is minimized.</p>
<p>On platforms that support it (such as Android) an on-screen virtual keyboard can be shown or hidden. When shown, keypresses from the virtual keyboard will be sent as char events just as if typed from an actual keyboard. Show or hide it by calling <a class="el" href="a00157.html#a9a8e1073c5e29bac46a0183a803d6df4">SetScreenKeyboardVisible()</a>. The <a class="el" href="a00322.html" title="UI subsystem. Manages the graphical user interface.">UI</a> subsystem can also automatically show the virtual keyboard when a <a class="el" href="a00169.html" title="Single-line text editor UI element.">LineEdit</a> element is focused, and hide it when defocused. This behavior can be controlled by calling <a class="el" href="a00322.html#ad589c4fa698684727046bfd1da5e8854">SetUseScreenKeyboard()</a>. </p>
