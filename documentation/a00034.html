<div class="textblock"><p>Classes that derive from <a class="el" href="a00270.html" title="Base class for objects with automatic serialization through attributes.">Serializable</a> can perform automatic serialization to binary or XML format by defining <a class="el" href="a00066.html">attributes</a>. Attributes are stored to the <a class="el" href="a00099.html" title="Urho3D execution context. Provides access to subsystems, object factories and attributes, and event receivers.">Context</a> per class. Scene load/save and network replication are both implemented by having the <a class="el" href="a00200.html" title="Scene node that may contain components and child nodes.">Node</a> and <a class="el" href="a00089.html" title="Base class for components. Components can be created to scene nodes.">Component</a> classes derive from <a class="el" href="a00270.html" title="Base class for objects with automatic serialization through attributes.">Serializable</a>.</p>
<p>The supported attribute types are all those supported by <a class="el" href="a00324.html" title="Variable that supports a fixed set of types.">Variant</a>, excluding pointers. Attributes can either define a direct memory offset into the object, or setter &amp; getter functions. Zero-based enumerations are also supported, so that the enum values can be stored as text into XML files instead of just numbers. For editing, the attributes also have human-readable names.</p>
<p>To implement side effects to attributes, for example that a <a class="el" href="a00200.html" title="Scene node that may contain components and child nodes.">Node</a> needs to dirty its world transform whenever the local transform changes, the default attribute access functions in <a class="el" href="a00270.html" title="Base class for objects with automatic serialization through attributes.">Serializable</a> can be overridden. See <a class="el" href="a00270.html#a3785d97ef92557bab8239688af94ac5e">OnSetAttribute()</a> and <a class="el" href="a00270.html#a938ff9d35938771da3843f3fa129ed21">OnGetAttribute()</a>.</p>
<p>Each attribute can have a combination of the following flags:</p>
<ul>
<li>AM_FILE: Is used for file serialization (load/save.)</li>
<li>AM_NET: Is used for network replication.</li>
<li>AM_LATESTDATA: Frequently changing data for network replication, where only the latest values matter. Used for motion and animation.</li>
<li>AM_NOEDIT: Is an internal attribute and is not to be shown for editing.</li>
<li>AM_NODEID: Is a node ID and may need rewriting when instantiating scene content.</li>
<li>AM_COMPONENTID: Is a component ID and may need rewriting when instantiating scene content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default flags are AM_FILE and AM_NET. Note that it is legal to define neither AM_FILE or AM_NET, meaning the attribute has only run-time significance (perhaps for editing.) </p>
