<div class="textblock"><p>A <a class="el" href="a00335.html" title="Component that describes global rendering properties">Zone</a> controls ambient lighting and fogging. Each geometry object determines the zone it is inside (by testing against the zone's oriented bounding box) and uses that zone's ambient light color, fog color and fog start/end distance for rendering. For the case of multiple overlapping zones, zones also have an integer priority value, and objects will choose the highest priority zone they touch.</p>
<p>The viewport will be initially cleared to the fog color of the zone found at the camera's far clip distance. If no zone is found either for the far clip or an object, a default zone with black ambient and fog color will be used.</p>
<p>Zones have two special flags: override mode and ambient gradient. If the camera is inside a zone with override mode enabled, all rendered objects will use that zone's ambient and fog settings, instead of the zone they belong to. This can be used for example to implement an underwater effect. When ambient gradient mode is enabled, the zone's own ambient color value is not used, but instead it will look for two highest-priority neighbor zones that touch it at the minimum and maximum Z face of its oriented bounding box: any objects inside will then get a per-vertex ambient color fade between the neighbor zones' ambient colors.</p>
<p>Zones also define a lightmask and a shadowmask (with all bits set by default.) An object's final lightmask for light culling is determined by ANDing the object lightmask and the zone lightmask. The final shadowmask is also calculated in the same way. </p>
