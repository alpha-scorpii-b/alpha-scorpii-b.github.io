Bolderline is the latest game made with Urho3D by Indonesian based game studio [Dolanan Games](http://twitter.com/dolanangames/).

Bolderline is a minimalist puzzle game with colorful blocks that will challenge your brain.

Gameplay is simple. Random block pieces fall down on the upper side of the screen.

Your goal is to destroy them by arranging the bricks on the lower side of the screen with the same color to match the shape of the block.
