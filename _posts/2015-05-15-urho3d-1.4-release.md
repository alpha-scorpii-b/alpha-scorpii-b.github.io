### Changelog
- Direct3D11 and OpenGL 3 rendering. Shader Model 2 support removed.
- Experimental Emscripten support.
- Raspberry-Pi 2 support.
- Overhauled build system with better out-of-source build support & source tree reorganization.
- Add host-tool building support for cross-compiling build which makes enabling of Lua/LuaJIT on Android build easier to configure than before and also makes new URHO3D_PACKAGING build option possible.
- Add new engine parameter to set the location of the asset/resource prefix path. This addition makes new URHO3D_MACOSX_BUNDLE build option possible.
- Add proper precompiled header (PCH) support for GCC/Clang compiler toolchains (and their derivatives).
- Add compiler cache (ccache) support to build system for host systems where ccache is installable. The support is available for both native and cross-compiler toolchains.
- Crowd navigation and dynamic navigation mesh using the DetourCrowd and DetourTileCache libraries.
- 2D rendering improvements and optimization.
- Allow materials to use any texture unit; up to 8 consecutive material texture units available for desktop graphics.
- Depth-only rendering pass and readable hardware depth support.
- Cubemap support and using programmatically defined rendertargets in renderpaths.
- Vertex and index buffer access from script through VectorBuffer.
- UI can be rendered to a texture with a renderpath command.
- Uncompressed DDS support: generic decode to 8-bit RGBA.
- Dynamic audio types instead of hardcoded.
- Dynamic cursor image type definitions.
- Added various material techniques.
- Allow reading Data/CommandLine.txt on all platforms, if Urho3DPlayer is started without parameters.
- LOD level support in Terrain collision shape.
- Reduce cost of rendering multiple materials with same shader parameter values, reduce shader switching cost on D3D9, and other rendering efficiency optimizations.
- Refactored event subscription mechanism with Lua.
- Add SpritePacker utility.
- User configurable indentation for XML and JSON files.
- Controls class moved away from Network subdirectory to allow using when Urho3D is built without networking.
- MOBILE_GRAPHICS & DESKTOP_GRAPHICS defines for graphics capability level, to avoid hardcoded platform checks.
- Remove bell sound when pressing Alt key combinations on Windows.
- 8-bit time stamp added to client controls sent over the network. Allow to intercept attribute updates from network. These features should allow writing custom clientside prediction.
- Return hit submesh index in raycast to StaticModel.
- Fill mode added to materials.
- AngelScript script objects can be stored in a Variant.
- Improved attribute registration: class name and variant type not needed.
- Add new rake tasks to facilitate configuring/generating and building Urho3D project, including external project using Urho3D library.
- Update PugiXml to 1.5.
- Update STB libraries to latest.
- Editor: particle effect editor window.
- Editor: sound type editor window.
- Editor: remember script attributes and restore them if a compile error occurs.
- Editor: remember custom var names globally in the editor configuration.
- Editor: button-based editor for bitmask attributes.
- Editor: duplicate operation.
- Editor: resource browser improvements.
- Editor: renderpath can be chosen.
- Editor: allow running without Urho2D compiled in.
- Editor: inspector lock.
- Editor: ensure correct gizmo size in orthographic mode.
- Editor: copy camera transform operation.
- Editor: do not allow to set a dialog modal in the UI editor.
- Fix mouse stutter by using SDL_PollEvent() instead of SDL_PumpEvents().
- Fix various missing script bindings.
- Fix missing editor grid after scene revert.
- Fix StaticModelGrup alpha materials rendering only 1 instance.
- Fix missing attribute side effects (ApplyAttributes) in attribute animation.
- Fix billboard render sorting from several views on the same frame.
- Fix editor to load UI assets from executable directory to prevent using old UI assets from user's resource directories.
- Fix UI element drag showing "not accepted" mistakenly.
- Fix WritePackedQuaternion() always returning false.
- Fix uninitialized variable in Shader class.
- Fix wrong camera aspect ratio after modifying orthographic size.
- Fix "lightvolumes" render path command not allowing custom shader defines.
- Fix AnimatedSprite2D not hiding child sprites when disabled.
- Fix missing export specifiers for some Urho3D classes.
- Fix additive particle scale modification making the particle size negative.
- Fix screen orientation issue on iOS 8.
- Fix multiple view rendering for 2D drawables.
- Fix Bullet friction on Clang compiler.
- Fix textures left bound in multiple units on OpenGL.
- Fix infinite loop in ResourceCache::AddPackageFile().
- Fix corrupt network message reception by updating kNet library.
- Fix NaN check working incorrectly on GCC.
- Fix possible wrong logic when a component is removed from a scene node, as opposed to being destroyed.
- Fix tab escape sequences in the generated script documentation.
- Fix warnings that leak into Urho3D applications.
- Fix being able to create a REPLICATED component into a LOCAL node.
- Fix negative light direction from Assimp with certain 3D file formats.
- Fix spot light FOV handling with Assimp.
- Fix incorrect partial terrain update and improve terrain update worst-case performance.
- Fix incorrect rendering to backbuffer after post-process pingponging on OpenGL.
- Fix crash when calling FixInterpolation() incorrectly on a compressed sound resource.
- Fix AngelScript compile on VS2015.
- Fix crash with null materials in 2D rendering.
- Fix kNet WinXP compatibility.
- Fix possible threaded resource load issues with XML files.
- Fix missing null checks in AnimatedSprite2D.
- Fix window drag behavior with hidden mouse on Linux; require click in window before re-enabling hidden mouse on all desktop OS'es.
- Fix erratic hidden mouse move when used together with touch input.
- Fix black screen on OSX after fullscreen/windowed switch.
- Fix incorrectly working AngelScript native calls on Clang / Windows.
- Fix building of 32-bit Linux software package on 64-bit host system and add options for build system to produce correct "LIB_SUFFIX" for 64-bit Debian and RPM packages.
