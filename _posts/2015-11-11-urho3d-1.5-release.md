### Changelog
- Database subsystem with either SQLite or ODBC support.
- Localization subsystem.
- Improved the navigation / crowd navigation API and examples.
- SSE and animation performance optimizations.
- Enable BT_USE_SSE on Linux and MinGW platforms, enable BT_USE_NEON on Android and Raspberry-Pi platforms.
- Urho3D macros such as OBJECT, EVENT, HANDLER renamed to have URHO3D_ prefix to prevent ambiguity with other libraries.
- Double support to Variant, Deserializer, Serializer & JSONValue. Store Lua object attributes accurately as doubles.
- Support for moving nodes & components between scenes, or creating components "sceneless" and moving into a scene later.
- Cubemap loading from DDS files.
- Refactored the object class registration mechanism to store the object's base class for "Is this class derived from this" queries.
- Optional "raw" Lua file loading through direct filesystem access for easier debugging.
- Configurable blend mode in renderpath quad commands.
- UV coordinates added to raycast results.
- Allow submitting bare function names instead of full signature to Execute() & DelayedExecute() in AngelScript, similar to specifying event handler functions.
- Allow negative scale for nodes.
- Culling camera optimization for viewports, to allow rendering multiple viewports with the same culling data set.
- Refactor Urho2D animation playback. Add optional Spine support (user must supply Spine runtime.)
- Refactor Urho2D sprite atlas handling.
- CollisionShape acquires model resource from StaticModel in same node automatically if collision model undefined.
- Request the high-power GPU on AMD multi-GPU setups.
- API for programmatic animation track & keyframe creation.
- Added AnimationController IsAtEnd() function.
- Added "remove on completion" mechanism to AnimationController.
- Added function to remove all components of type to Node.
- Added GetParentComponent() function to Node.
- Added resource memory usage stats to DebugHud.
- Support for ScanDir() on Android.
- Improve Variant / VariantMap bindings on Lua.
- Improve internal mechanisms for Lua bindings, e.g. store Urho3D context inside Lua state global table.
- Improve API for kNet connection stats.
- Improve AngelScript GetChildrenWithClassName() to return also derived classes.
- Improve UI tab behavior
- Improved navigation debug geometry
- Improve ConvexCast by taking into account CollisionShape's offset position & rotation.
- Spline class cleanup & improvements, including linear interpolation mode, and looping Catmull-Rom mode.
- Refactored JSONValue class to be more JSON-like.
- Material render order support within a pass.
- MM_FREE mouse mode, which disassociates cursor visibility from being confined inside the window.
- Allow doubleclick event in UI over emptiness
- Make Octree::Raycast() threadsafe.
- GetGLContext() added to GraphicsImpl on OpenGL to allow the application to perform manual context switching.
- Fixes for vertex texture fetch on D3D11.
- Allow optional forced creation of CPU-only vertex & index buffers also in non-headless operation.
- Unified texture upload behavior: half-float formats need to be provided as such on both D3D & OpenGL. Added float/half-float conversion functions.
- Automatic generation of intermediate directories in FileSystem::CreateDir().
- Warn if attempting infinite distance physics raycast. Remove erroneous infinity default value from AngelScript physics raycast bindings.
- Allow non-strict numeric type to be returned from Variant, e.g. GetFloat() succeeds for an int.
- Allow to disable PhysicsWorld or PhysicsWorld2D automatic simulation stepping during scene update. When disabled, the physics world can still be stepped manually.
- Support for manual advancing of value animations.
- globalVars VariantMap for AngelScript to allow easy cross-ScriptFile parameter passing.
- Improve ConvexCast() to return distance using the hit fraction.
- Ensure normalized vertex weights in AssetImporter, and clamp to 4 weights maximum instead of error, by dropping the smallest weights.
- Configurable layer count in DynamicNavigationMesh to control memory usage.
- Emscripten ETC1 & PVRTC extension support detection.
- Emscripten hardware instancing support.
- emscripten_get_now() for better timer precision and less CPU use.
- Disable frame limiter Sleep() on Emscripten.
- Disable audio output in C++ samples where it isn't necessary.
- Remove redundant glEnable() / glDisable() calls related to OpenGL texture types.
- Removed defined_ member variable from BoundingBox, Sphere & Rect in favor of determining the definedness from the bounds being valid.
- Invalid order checking for Lua binding overloads.
- Dangerous math class constructors marked explicit.
- Properly enabled multithreading in GCC/Clang builds.
- Emscripten toolchain & build related fixes and improvements.
- Clang tools support in the build.
- Annotator & script binding extractor skeleton tools in preparation for generated script bindings.
