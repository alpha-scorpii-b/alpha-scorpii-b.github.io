We have now a dark theme for the website to ease reading our documentation pages at night! The theme can be selected by using the theme switcher. The theme switcher uses experimental filter feature available in the Webkit-based and Firefox browsers. It also requires JavaScript enabled for it to work.

The functionality has been tested thoroughly on the above mentioned browsers. The functionality may or may not work on other browsers, sorry. But let us know about it.
