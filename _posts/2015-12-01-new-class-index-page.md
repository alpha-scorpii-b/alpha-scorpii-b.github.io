A few days ago one of the contributor has submitted a PR to switch on the generation of the class index page for our doxygen-generated documentation. The new index page can now be accessed under the 'Classes' documentation navigation button in our main website. We have improved the usability of this class index page. It is also vieweable using a wide variety of browser viewport sizes like all our pages do. Happy coding!
