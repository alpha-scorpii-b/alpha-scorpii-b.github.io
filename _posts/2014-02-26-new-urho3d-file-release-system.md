As Google Code no longer allows new upload of binary packages and GitHub pages or repositories are not convenient for them, all our future release of binary packages and snapshot build artifacts from Travis CI will be uploaded to [sourceforge.net/projects/urho3d](https://sourceforge.net/projects/urho3d/). The packages for Urho3D releases will be in their respective release folder. While those snapshot packages will always be available in 'Snapshots' folder to indicate that they are auto generated by CI build without human QA, so users who download them should manage their expectation on the quality or stability of the binaries in the package.
